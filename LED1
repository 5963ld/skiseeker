The Handicapped Water Ski Nationals
 were in my area,very impressive
how they were able to navigate on a pair 
or slolem.To the Def and blind
a side person gave types of communication 
physically to the skier.A type of buzzer that 
The skier can feel attached 
That will give him/her references to there 
maneuver points..aka apple watches(example)
with program capability to help with navigation.
